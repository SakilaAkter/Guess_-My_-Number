# Guess_-My_-Number

This project was built as part of a JavaScript course ( https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) assignment to practice DOM manipulation.The html,css,.prettierrc files were given and the game logic was implemented by me using javascript.


ðŸŽ® Guess My Number!
A fun number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The computer randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 20, and you have to guess it.
With every wrong attempt, your score decreases â€” so guess wisely!

ðŸ“Œ About the Game
This is a simple project to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation.
The player interacts with the game via input fields and buttons, and the game dynamically updates messages, scores, and styles based on the guesses.

1.	A random number between 1 and 20 is generated.
2.	Enter your guess and click Check!.
3.	Feedback messages will appear:
